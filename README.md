Mobile application made for educational purposes. This simple app allows you to create your todo list and save it in the cloud. To create this app I use react native technology. You can download and test it from the [AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/pl/app/tasktask/id6444321606?l=pl) or GooglePlay.

## Tech stack

- React native, expo

## Project organization

I use ignite react native boilerplate to initially setup my project. I followed the folder structure proposed by this template. I can fully recommend this project you can check it [here](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite) it has generators and some ready to use components that can speed up your implementation process.
